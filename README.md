# Description of the project
	This project you control a robot who is placed in a house, 
	you can explore the house and a platform right outside. 

	There is a fireplace with a particle system which simulates a real fire. 
	In the main room of the house there are 3 spinning hologram platforms present,
	each of which have a guitar which scales depending on the frequency of the music played. 
	The player when they move outside they can look for a star which reacts to their voice. 

	In the distance a lot of starships can be seen,
	with one of them going in a circular motion around various axis, 
	the rest of the starships use the seek and arrive theory of artificial intelligence,
	in order to move in accordance with the first starship.


	The starships, guitar, fireplace and sofa are all created in blender
# Instructions for use
	The user can move in Virtual Reality using their two controllers
	The right controllers button is responsible for turning,
	where as the left controller is responsible for moving.
	the individual can walk on the various platforms to explore the world


# How it works
### Model combined with camera
A model has been imported from the asset store of a robot.
this Model is then rigged to have both hand movements, leg movements and head movements.
##### Leg Movement 
To get the leg movement working,
I have followed a tutorial to get the legs to move in accordance to the rate of movement of the camera

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
	I aim of my project is to incorporate music and sci-fi into one, similar to the self playing guitar or piano idea shown in the brief but with a bit more groovyness, i aim to have the guitar produce music  from a hologramic point of view. I also aim for each key of the guitar to be reflected in the song. As well as the user being able to play a guitar of their own to produce music in the virtual reality environment which will be reflected by the background changing.

	I plan to implement this idea by having a guitar hologram playing a song, and a seperate function of the user being able to play their guitar and it reflecting in the background in a virtual reality setting
## This is how to markdown text:

# class "scale from microphone"
```c#
void Update()
    {
        float loudness = detector.GetLoudnessFromMicrophone() * loudnessSensibility;

        if ( loudness<threshold)
            loudness =0;
        transform.localScale= Vector3.Lerp(minScale,maxScale,loudness);
    }
```
Gets the loudnessFromMicrophone class from a different file and compares it then it scales it relative to the variables
# class "GetLoudnessFromMicrophone"
```c#
    public float GetLoudnessFromMicrophone()
    {
        return GetLoudnessFromAudioClip(Microphone.GetPosition(Microphone.devices[0]),microphoneClip);
    }
```
Gets loudness from a clip 
# class "GetLoudnessFromAudioClip"
```c#
    public float GetLoudnessFromAudioClip(int clipPosition, AudioClip clip)
    {
        int startPosition = clipPosition- sampleWindow;
        if(startPosition<0)
            return 0;

        float[] waveData = new float[sampleWindow];
        clip.GetData(waveData,startPosition);

        //compute loudness
        float totalLoudness = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < sampleWindow; i++)
        {
            totalLoudness+= Mathf.Abs(waveData[i]);
        }
        return totalLoudness/ sampleWindow;
    }
```
Uses GetData to fetch data from the microphone which is in the form of a wave
# class "CircularMovement"
```c#
    void Update()
    {
        if (angle >= 360f)
            angle = 0f;
            posX =  centerRotation.position.x + Mathf.Cos (angle) * radiusRotation;
            posY =  centerRotation.position.y + Mathf.Sin (angle) * radiusRotation;
            posZ =  centerRotation.position.z + Mathf.Sin (angle) * radiusRotation;
            angle += Time.deltaTime * angularSpeed;
        

        transform.position = new Vector3(posX,posY,posZ);
    }
```
Makes the main spaceship rotate in a circular way
# class "ParticleAI"
```c#
    void Update()
    {
        otherParticleMesh.SetDestination(particleObj.position);
    }
```
Helps with Artificial intelligence of agents to follow the object
# class "Randomrotate"
```c#
    void Update()
    {
        rotateS = speed * Time.deltaTime;
        transform.Rotate(0, rotateS, 0);
    }
```
Rototate the hologram platforms


# Most Proud of 
I am the most proud of managing the system of walking as well as implementing audio design to my application which greatly enchances the quality of the game.

# Instructions
In  XR interaction too have the script of interaction manager
Main vr camera should have audio listener
locomotion systemshould have conitnues move provider and turn provider
Robot kyle rig root should have a rig builder connected to upper body and lower body
Alongside two bone IK contraint in the hands and legs and a multi-parent in the head
Mirror has audio source with the song of choice
In different spaceships have a nav mesh agent in the spaceship (1)
Circular movement in spaceship
Holograms rotating 
Guitar with audio loudnesstester

# Installed packages
Animation rigging 
physics 
probuilder
Artificial intelligence
XR interaction toolkit
Xr plugin management
