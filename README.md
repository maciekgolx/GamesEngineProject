Student Number: C19389881

Class Group:DT228

# Description of the project
	I aim of my project is to incorporate music and sci-fi into one, similar to the self playing guitar or piano idea shown in the brief but with a bit more groovyness, i aim to have the guitar produce music  from a hologramic point of view. I also aim for each key of the guitar to be reflected in the song. As well as the user being able to play a guitar of their own to produce music in the virtual reality environment which will be reflected by the background changing
# Instructions for use
	I plan to implement this idea by having a guitar hologram playing a song, and a seperate function of the user being able to play their guitar and it reflecting in the background in a virtual reality setting

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
